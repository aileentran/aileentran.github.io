<h3>"All roads lead to Rome."</h3>

A full-stack Flask application for commuters with multiple modes of transportation. Users can create routes with many stops, choose the mode of transportation, and save it. The application will return accurate travel times based on live traffic information and render both visual and text directions.

#### *Insipiration:*
I never lived in an area with extensive public transportation until I moved up to the Bay Area and started working in San FranciscoðŸŒ‰. The different options to commute to SF was staggering and I could never quite accurately predict when I would arrive.

Since the Google Maps app on the phone makes you pick only one mode of transportation, I would spend many sleepy minutes *on the toilet* wrestling with  Google Maps to jigsaw my way to the best commuting combination (drive/Bart/bus/walk/etc) by keeping combinations of ETAs summed up in my mind to *hopefully* arrive at my destination on time. ðŸ¤¯ It was exhausting and I'm sure many folks commuting in urban areas have to deal with the same thing.

So, as soon as I had the tools to build tech, Roam was born! And, the most rewarding part was when I was able to use Roam on my daily commute. It was satisfying to enjoy (and constantly improve) the fruits of my labor. ðŸ¥³
