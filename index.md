title: ✨About Me✨
---
I was previously a health psychology researcher at UCSF and UC Berkeley. I remained interested in health care and decided to complete pre-requisites for Physical Therapy school. I was accepted into the UCSF/SFSU DPT program. However, after receiving the financial aid package and making several dynamic spreadsheets, I decided to pivot to software engineering instead. I look forward to creating tools to support others in their daily lives and well-being in languages such as Python, Javascript, HTML, and others.

When I am not programming, I enjoy doing yoga, practicing(a large variety of) martial arts, tea/tea culture, long conversations, and snuggling my two dogs.
