title: About Me âœ¨

After graduating with a Psychology, BA from UCLA, I became a clinical and health psychology researcher at UCSF and UC Berkeley. Even though I loved being at the cutting edge of knowledge and being surrounded by highly intelligent individuals, a lot of a researcher's work ends up in a vacuum and I wanted to help people more directly.

So, I explored the healthcare field and  decided to complete pre-requisites for Physical Therapy school. There was something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but I was directly helping people by literally lifting them up. Besides, I was accepted into the UCSF/SFSU DPT program, which was my dream program. However, after receiving the financial aid package, I made several dynamic spreadsheets to see if I could afford it and I discovered that I couldn't.

Even though my calculator spelled the end of my career, I discovered the thing I was missing from both research and healthcare was creativity! So, I decided to pivot to software engineering and have never looked back.

When I am not programming, I enjoy doing yoga, practicing a wide variety of martial arts, learning about tea and tea culture, having long conversations, and snuggling my two dogs.
