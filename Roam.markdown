#### *"All roads lead to Rome."* 

A full-stack Flask application for commuters with multiple modes of transportation. Users can create routes with many stops, choose the mode of transportation, and save it. The application will return accurate travel times based on live traffic information and render both visual and text directions.

#### *Insipiration:* 
I never lived in an area with extensive public transportation until I moved up to the Bay Area and started working in San Francisco. The different options  to commute to SF was staggering and I could never quite accurately predict when I would arrive. 

Since the Google Maps app on the phone makes you pick only one mode of transportation, I would spend many sleepy minutes *on the toilet* wrestling with the Google Maps on my phone to figure out the optimal Bart station to drive to, Bart/train to hop on, and stop to get off in order to *hopefully* arrive at my destination on time. I would have to keep all the ETAs in my mind and jigsaw my way to the best combination. It was exhausting and I'm sure many folks living in urban areas have to deal with the same thing. Hence, once I had the tools to make it, Roam was born!
